- TensorFlow [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- Sklearn [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)


# Open-source code
You can always search [paperswithcode-computer vision](https://paperswithcode.com/area/computer-vision), they provide [State-of-the-Art](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) papers and codes vary from computer vision, NLP, Robotics,...etc.

# Tools
## 1. Package version control tool - virtual environment
Say goodbye to conda, pipenv and virtualenv. Go and check [venv-cli](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli.git) (Ubuntu)
Well, if you are using Windows, I recommend you choose one of the virtual environment management tools.

Don't mix up and use both conda and pip for installation, it may not cause errors but hard for version control of packages.
- virtualenv - Old version mostly for python2
