# Tools
## 1. Package version control tool - virtual environment
Say goodbye to conda, pipenv and virtualenv. Go and check [venv-cli](https://github.com/SallingGroup-AI-and-ML/venv-cli.git) (Ubuntu)

Well, if you are using Windows, I recommend you choose one of the virtual environment management tools.

Don't mix up and use both conda and pip for installation, it may not cause errors but hard for version control of packages.
- virtualenv - Old version mostly for python2
- venv - Unable to specify non-existent Python environment versions, and lacks management of system-wide environments (like selecting an existing virtual environment). By default, venv stores environments within project folders, complicating project file management.
- pipenv Unstable for cross-platform; running `pip install ...` twice may yield different results.
- conda - I used a lot when I was a beginner, I recommand only use the terminal for conda.
